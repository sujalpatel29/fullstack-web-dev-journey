# Fullstack Web Development Journey 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This repository represents my structured learning journey in **Full Stack Web Development**, where I practiced concepts module-by-module through hands-on exercises and mini implementations.
Instead of only theoretical notes, this repo focuses on **practical coding**, experimentation, and building a strong foundation across frontend and backend technologies.

The content here reflects my continuous progress — starting from core web fundamentals and gradually moving toward backend development and database integration.
